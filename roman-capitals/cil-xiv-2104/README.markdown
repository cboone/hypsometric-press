## Notes.

### Citation.

This inscription is identified as CIL XIV 2104 = D 1475.

In other words, [Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum][], volume XIV -- Inscriptiones Latii veteris Latinae, inscription 2104. And, as mentioned [above][ILS 1475], by Dessau as [ILS][] 1475.


### Other references.

Christopher Bruun discusses it briefly in footnote 62 of his paper [Some Comments on the Status of Imperial Freedman][Bruun].

Discussion of it also appears in [The Classical Review][], [Zeutschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik][ZPE] (in addition to the Bruun paper already mentioned), and in [_Imperium Romanum Triburim Descriptum._][IRTD]


### The type.

In his reproduction, Mr Goudy made use of his own [Goudy Old Style][], which was modeled on Roman capitals.

In my reproduction of Mr Goudy's reproduction, I am primarily using [Sorts Mill Goudy][], by [Barry Schwartz][], which is itself a revival of Goudy Old Style. Generally very accurate and faithful to the original, Sorts Mill Goudy is missing one crucial character: the angular interpunct. Instead, Mr Schwartz has included a middle dot that is of the style of current typefaces.

Thus, I have also made use of a second typeface: [Goudy Twenty][], a revival by [Dieter Steffmann][] which is generally not in the spirit of Goudy Old Style and Sorts Mill Goudy, but includes a perfect copy of Goudy's interpunct.


## Questions.

### About Goudy's reproduction.

The leading of the inscription is questionable. Other comparable Roman inscriptions tend to be set solid.


### About the meaning.

If Aurelio Aphrodisius was a _procurator a rationibus_ under Augustus, how could he have been both a freedman and an eques?
