Typography - @font-face rules.
By Christopher Boone: http://hypsometry.com

Hypsography uses Sorts Mill Goudy, in its roman and italic variants. This typeface was originally designed
by Frederic Goudy, and this revival is the work of the Barry Schwartz.

The CSS in this file is based on files generated by the Font Squirrel: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator
That CSS is, in turn, based on the work of Paul Irish: http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/

Notes:

- Sorts Mill Goudy is being defined twice, once for the roman, and once for the italic.
- In both cases, I'm first providing the EOT URL for IE. IE cannot understand format hints, so
  the EOT src value is provided on its own.
- In some cases, due to a buggy and inconsistent implementation of @font-face, Opera will fail
  to display the proper typeface if an EOT is declared on its own line, first in the list.
  But only in some cases. Not here, it appears.
- Next I list the possible local names of the font. It's not particularly likely that any reader
  already has a copy, but a couple lines of gzipped CSS are worth the try. In all cases I list
  the typeface's real name first, followed by its Postscript name, for Safari to use. Then the more
  general family name, in case that matches better. Sorts Mill Goudy has been distributed under two
  different names, so both are listed.
- Then comes the data most likely to be displayed in the browser: the OpenType (in the case of
  the roman and italic) and TrueType (in the case of the small capitals) font files, included inline
  via the data URL technique, encoded in base 64. This increases overall file size, but reduces by 3/4
  the number of font related downloads. Also, the server that Hypsography lives on doesn't
  enjoy gzipping font files, but loves to gzip CSS. The major downside of this technique is that
  the browsers that can't use this data - IE, Mobile Webkit, and Chrome - still have to download it,
  in addition to whatever other data they need.
- The format hint in the case of the OpenType and TrueType font src is actually optional, since
  Safari, Firefox, and Opera will treat OpenType and TrueType fonts appropriately regardless of
  which format you indicate; but I've included it for clarity.
- Last comes the SVG URL, provided for Mobile Webkit and Chrome.
- According to the spec, we should be able to specify multiple forms of the same font-family, using
  multiple @font-face declarations, each containing different styling information. Currently, this is
  poorly supported. Using font-style: italic, as I've done here, seems to work. I've used the same
  font-family in two @font-faces, and when I call for the italic version in the site's CSS Firefox
  and Safari seem to do the right thing.
